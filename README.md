# RobotC-VEX-Bilingual-Commands
Bilingual RobotC template with commands in Spanish and English that made easier to code for the Clawbot and the Testbed. 

This template is preconfigured for the same elements that the Testbed of the POE PLTW program, but only with a small modification, it has no flashlight and motors are connected to ports 1 and 10 (you will not need to attach any motor controller to it).

Also, I include the commands to move the clawbot connecting the motors to 1 and 10 as well (leftMotor and rightMotor) and a example of how to move the robot and beat the labyrinth challenge.

Please feel free to use it in your classes. Is a work in progress, but you can check in this video how it works!

Explanation on video about how to use the code and how to pass the labyrinth challenge.

EXTRA: The commands are going to be in Spanish as well really soon!

UPDATE: NOW YOU CAN USE IT AS A LIBRARY!

HOW TO USE IT:

1. Copy and paste the following line of code in your program, between the #pragma block and the main method:

```c
#include "robotx.h"	//Includes the RobotX
```
2. Download and place the robotx.h file on the same folder that your program.
3. Enjoy the new commands and the Spanish commands.
